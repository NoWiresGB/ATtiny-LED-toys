You guessed it.  An ATtiny85V powered pumpkin toy.

Adaptation of the Robot code incorporating some candle flash code from Electrick_RWM

This is very hacky as lots of code in the main loop and the interrupt classes.
However, it works and it's not mission critical code.

We're only using the Fader class from Robot for some spooky red eye LEDs that operate independently of the other code.

Electrick's code also incorporates a switch to trigger from glow to flicker code.  I've just left the pin hanging
as I like the flicker the floating pin seems to settle on.  If you want, connect a switch or build an unstable "wind"
switch with foil and a bit of copper wire for the intended effect.
