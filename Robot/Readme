An ATtiny85V powered robot toy.

Consists of 3 different LED classes for Fading, Flashing, and Toggling LEDs.
It's a bit of a hack as all processing is done in interrupts.
Main loop is empty, timer interrupt runs in background continuously.
Warning. interrupts are not disabled during processing so routines must exit within 1ms.  No issue here.

Toy is couple of boxes glued together and painted.  PWM pulsing beacon on head, flashing eyes, and toggling chains
of LEDs on chest arranged in a pattern.
